            </strong>
My childhood was full of adventures, stories of every kind, having to find princesses and exterminate monsters. Fables and tales told by passionate people. That’s where my desire to tell stories comes from in my own way, and therefore my creativity. Some say that’s where my eccentricity comes from.

I begin to apprehend the web very early on the old computer which rotated in turn, when my brothers would leave it to me. It is from this moment that my passion for the Internet, its history and its culture is confirmed.

It is therefore quite natural that after my baccalaureate in literature I began to become in my turn, a creator, by training myself autonomously on the platforms that have made my entertainment until then, but that today give me the necessary tools to evolve.

In my race, some companies saw a certain potential to trust me, to work with them, and for others, to train me, even internationally.

Today, Qyu is what represents my name as a creator, in audiovisual and graphic production.

                        <p>Casey «Scorteck» Beaugrand is a high-level FPS player who has made the success of several E-sport teams such as Exalty, Oserv or Oplon, and recently Rivage. Coming from the far north of the France, he is known by many of his comrades and enemies, to be the one who practices the art of the Victory Royale, in his bed, and destroy the competition in this way. Scorteck has trusted to take on his Youtube channel, to be 
highlighted through video editing, whether to present his performances, or make his audience laugh. I also give him some visibility by advising him on Twitter, but also by pushing forward his Youtube channel, so that he can reach weekly records in terms of popularity.</p>

                        <p>Les Ateliers de Thierry is a wandering pastry company, that teaches to young and old alike how to make delicious creations with their hands. Thierry is a great chef who has worked in many prestigious restaurants, and who is there to guarantee you a fun and playful moment in his pastry workshops in Ariège. Thierry has trusted me to provide him with some graphic and photo help he needs, in order to promote his workshop to his clients.</p>

                        <p>Skars… Well, that’s me. That’s how I started to touch to the magic of editing. I made videos in my spare time, because I found it amusing, but mostly because I wanted to make my friends laugh.  I made very few views, despite all the pleasure I drew to do this was, as for my viewers, very fruitful. Unfortunately, I had to give up my channel to pursue other projects. Despite this, my previous work was not for nothing, because here you are, reading what I am writing.</p>

                        <p>Xavier «Vyn» Esnault is a developer that I would call touch to everything. He has worked for web, software, system, and network, but one of his passions is still AI. He has already designed programmed bots for the Discord application. He has also programmed for video games, including some pretty popular modules now on the Garry’s Mod workshop. So here he is because he coded the site I asked him to do from the instructions provided. She is a serious, competent person who knows how to make ingenious proposals to make a project more alive.</p>

                        <p>The Corner is basically a simple Discord between friends, but from time to time we make videos for some fun. It goes from “shitposting” with memes, to animation. But we are investing in making more content, in order to make this family become a real community.</p>

                        <p>Les S.P are a group of musicians from the great south of France, the Ariège. There to make you laugh, just as much as make you think with their revisited musics, with committed lyrics. A good time is guaranteed with these old gentlemen with a pronounced accent. I give them some help for new ideas, to put them forward, but also by making their posters, their logos, and also small projects.</p>
